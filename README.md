# ioBroker.knx
=================

This adapter is a knx for the creation of an ioBroker adapter. You do not need it at least that you plan developing your own adapter.

It includes both code running within iobroker and as vis widget. If you only plan to create a vis widget then you should use the [iobroker.vis-eib-knx](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.vis-eib-knx) instead.

##Steps 
1. download and unpack this packet from github ```https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.eib-knx/archive/master.zip```
  or clone git repository ```git clone https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.eib-knx.git```

2. download required npm packets. Write in ioBroker.eib-knx directory:

  ```npm install```
  
3. set name of this eib-knx. Call
  
  ```grunt rename --name=mynewname --email=email@mail.com --author="Author Name"```
  
  *mynewname* must be **lower** case and with no spaces.

  If grunt is not available, install grunt globally:
  
  ```npm install -g grunt-cli```
 
4. rename directory from *ioBroker.eib-knx* (can be *ioBroker.eib-knx-master*) to *iobroker.mynewname*

5. to use this eib-knx you should copy it into *.../iobroker/node_modules* directory and then create an instance for it with iobroker.admin

6. create your adapter:

  * you might want to start with knx.js (code running within iobroker) and admin/index.html (the adapter settings page).

  * [Installation, setup and first steps with an ioBroker Development Environment](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker/wiki/Installation,-setup-and-first-steps-with-an-ioBroker-Development-Environment)
  
  * [Write and debug vis widgets](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker/wiki/How-to-debug-vis-and-to-write-own-widget-set)
  
  * files under the www folders are made available under http://&lt;iobrokerIP&gt;:8082/&lt;adapter-name&gt;/
    * for this to work the iobroker.vis adapter has to be installed
    * delete this folder if you do not plan to export any files this way
    * call ```iobroker upload <adapter-name>``` after you change files in the www folder to get the new files uploaded to vis
  * the widget folder contains an example of a vis widget
    * you might want to start with *widget/<adapter-name>.html* and *widget/js/<adapter-name>.js*
    * call ```iobroker visdebug <adapter-name>``` to enable debugging and upload widget to "vis". (This works only from V0.7.15 of js-controller)
    * If you do not plan to export any widget then delete the whole widget folder and remove the ```"restartAdapters": ["vis"]``` statement from *io-package.json*
    * After admin/index.html is changed you must execute ```iobroker upload mynewname``` to see changes in admin console. The same is valid for any files in *admin* and *www* directory  

7. change version: edit package.json and then call ```grunt p``` in your adapter directory.
